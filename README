The goal of django-requires_js_css is to provide a way for individual templates to include their own JavaScript and CSS files, while at the same time adhering to site performance best practices.

This means that if you have, for example, a 'cool button' widget requested via a templatetag and defined by 'cool_button.html', you can specify 'cool_button.css' in the html file, and the css file will actually be loaded in the "HEAD" where it belongs (this is customizable though).
